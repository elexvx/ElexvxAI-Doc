# Introducing ElexvxAI v1.0

We are incredibly excited to announce the **first major release** of ElexvxAI — a platform built from the ground up to supercharge AI-powered development workflows.

## What's New

### Neural Optimization Engine

Our new `elexvx-opt` module provides state-of-the-art model compression techniques out of the box:

- **Quantization** — Reduce model size by up to 4× with minimal accuracy loss.
- **Pruning** — Automatically remove redundant weights for faster inference.
- **Distillation** — Train smaller models to mimic larger ones.

### Developer Experience

```bash
pip install elexvxai
```

```python
from elexvxai import optimize

model = optimize(your_model, strategy="quantize", bits=8)
```

### Performance Benchmarks

| Model       | Original Size | Optimized Size | Accuracy Drop |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| BERT-base   | 440 MB        | 112 MB         | < 0.5%       |
| GPT-2 small | 548 MB        | 140 MB         | < 1.0%       |
| LLaMA-7B    | 13.5 GB       | 3.5 GB         | < 0.8%       |

## What's Next

We're just getting started. The roadmap for v1.1 includes:

- Multi-GPU distributed optimization
- ONNX export support
- A visual model inspection dashboard

Thank you to our incredible community for all the feedback and support during the beta phase. We're excited to build the future of AI efficiency together.
