# Building Responsive Interfaces with Material UI v5

Material UI v5 ships with a powerful suite of layout primitives. In this post, we'll walk through building an interface that adapts seamlessly from mobile to widescreen.

## Grid vs Stack

The two primary layout components in MUI are `Grid` and `Stack`. Understanding when to use each is key.

### Grid — For 2D Layouts

Use `Grid` when content needs to arrange in both rows and columns.

```tsx
import Grid from '@mui/material/Grid';

<Grid container spacing={3}>
  <Grid size={{ xs: 12, md: 6 }}>
    <Card>Content A</Card>
  </Grid>
  <Grid size={{ xs: 12, md: 6 }}>
    <Card>Content B</Card>
  </Grid>
</Grid>
```

### Stack — For 1D Layouts

Use `Stack` when items flow in a single direction.

```tsx
import Stack from '@mui/material/Stack';

<Stack direction={{ xs: 'column', md: 'row' }} spacing={2}>
  <Button>Save</Button>
  <Button variant="outlined">Cancel</Button>
</Stack>
```

## Responsive Breakpoints

MUI uses a default breakpoint scale: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`. You can customize these in your theme:

```ts
import { createTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';

const theme = createTheme({
  breakpoints: {
    values: { xs: 0, sm: 600, md: 900, lg: 1200, xl: 1536 },
  },
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Mobile-first**: Always start with `xs` values and override upwards.
2. **Use `sx` for one-offs**: Don't create a new component just to set a margin.
3. **Avoid magic numbers**: Leverage MUI's `spacing` scale (`theme.spacing(2)` = 16px).

Responsive design with MUI becomes second nature once you internalize these patterns. Happy building!
