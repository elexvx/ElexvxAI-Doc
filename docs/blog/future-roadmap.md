# ElexvxAI Future Roadmap

We believe in transparency. Here's a candid look at what's on our engineering and product roadmap for the next six months.

## Q1 2026 — Foundation

- ✅ v1.0 release with core optimization engine
- ✅ Python SDK (`pip install elexvxai`)
- ✅ Documentation site launch
- 🔄 ONNX export pipeline

## Q2 2026 — Ecosystem Expansion

Our focus for Q2 is building a richer ecosystem around `elexvx-opt`:

### JavaScript / Node.js SDK

We are porting the core optimization library to WebAssembly, enabling browser-side model optimization for the first time.

### Visual Model Inspector

A web-based dashboard to visualize model layer sizes, weight distributions, and optimization potential before committing to a strategy.

### Hugging Face Integration

One-click optimization for any model on the Hugging Face Hub:

```python
from elexvxai.hub import optimize_from_hub

model = optimize_from_hub("meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf", strategy="quantize")
```

## Q3 2026 — Enterprise Features

- Multi-GPU distributed optimization for large models (> 30B params)
- Role-based access control for team environments
- Private model registry integration (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- SLA-backed support tiers

## Community Involvement

All our roadmap planning happens in the open. Join the discussion on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/elexvx) page or drop by our community Discord.

We're building this for you — your feedback shapes what we prioritize.
